# Neural Network and Deep Learning

This repo includes my implementation of some popular neural network architectures.

## Mnist Handwritten Digit Recognition

The classical mnist handwritten digit recognition problem. The numpy implementation is inspired by the book *[Neural Network and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)* written by Micheal Nielsen (The official implementation of this book can be found at https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).
